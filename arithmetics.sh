# var++            increase the value in var by 1

# There are several ways to perform arithmetic.

# 1. Use let built in function. It follows the format:
# let <arithmetic expression>
# The first part of the expression is generally a 
# variable which the result is saved into
let a=5+4 
echo $a

let "a = 5 + 4"
echo $a

let a++
echo $a 

let "a = 4 * 5"
echo $a 

let "a = $1 + 30"
echo $a 

# 2. Use expr built in function
# expr is similar to let except instead of saving the result 
# to a variable it displays to the terminal.
# expr follows the format:
# expr item1 operator item2
expr 5 + 4
expr 11 % 2
expr 5 \* $1

# You must have spaces between the items in the expression.
# expr 5+4

# 3. Use double paranthesis following the format:
# $(( expression ))
a=$(( 4 + 5 ))
echo $a 

a=$((3+5))
echo $a 

b=$(( a + 3 ))
echo $b 

(( b++ ))
echo $b 

(( b += 3))
echo $b 

a=$((4 * 5))
echo $a 

# If you want to get the length of a variable (how many characters),
# you can do the following:
# ${#variable}

a='Hello World'
echo ${#a}

b=4953
echo ${#b}
