# If you want to take input from the user, you use
# the read command, This command takes the input and
# saves it into a variable

# if you want to output something to the terminal,
# you use the echo command

# Display a prompt to the user
echo Hello, who am I talking to?
# Read user input into a variable
read varname
# Display a message to the user that includes the
# value stored in the variable
echo It\'s nice to meet you $varname

# you can alter the behavior of read with a variety of
# command line options
# the commonly used options are -p which allows you
# to specify a prompt and -s which makes the input
# silent.
# This can make it easy to ask for a username and
# passowrd combination
